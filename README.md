# Gesture-controlled-computer

Recently Gesture controlled Laptops or computers are getting very famous. This technique is called Leap motion which enables us to control certain functions on our computer/Laptop by simply waving our hand in front of it. It is very cool and fun to do it, but these laptops are really priced very high. So, in this project let us try building our own Gesture control Laptop/Computer by combining the Power of Arduino and Python.
